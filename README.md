Written in Matlab, this code is capable of simulating the nonlinear dynamics of highly flexible beam structures based on a finite element discretization of the geometrically exact beam model. It is resolved in the frequency domain with the solver MANLAB, available at the MANLAB website: <http://manlab.lma.cnrs-mrs.fr/>.

Several example test cases are included.
